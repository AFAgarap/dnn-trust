# Comparing deep learning models using trust score

## Introduction

Several efforts to improve deep learning performance have been done through the years, but there are only few works towards better understanding the models and their predictions, and whether they should be trusted or not. Since the re-emergence of neural networks in 2012 by famously winning the ImageNet Challenge (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), we have employed deep learning models in a variety of real-world applications--to the point where we always resort to deep learning to solve even the simplest problems. Such applications range from recommendation systems (Cheng et al., 2016) to medical diagnosis (Gulshan et al., 2016). However, despite the state-of-the-art performance of deep learning models in these specialized tasks, they are not infallible from committing mistakes, in which the degree of seriousness of such mistakes vary per application domain.
